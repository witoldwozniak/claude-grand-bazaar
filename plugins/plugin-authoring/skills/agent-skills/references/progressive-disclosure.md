# Progressive Disclosure Patterns

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** — Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** — When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** — As needed by Claude (unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context)

For narrow skills (single concern), keep SKILL.md under ~500 lines. Meta-skills (gateway/router) can be longer when the additional length is routing infrastructure (decision trees, reference overviews, conditional loading guidance). The test for both: "Could this section move to a reference without hurting Claude's ability to route to the right resource?" If yes, move it.

**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details into separate reference files.

## Pattern 1: High-Level Guide with References

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text with pdfplumber:
[code example]

## Advanced features

- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns
```

Claude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.

## Pattern 2: Domain-Specific Organization

For skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── references/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    ├── product.md (API usage, features)
    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
```

When a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.

Similarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants:

```
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)
    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)
    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)
```

When the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.

---

## Pattern 3: Conditional Details

Show basic content, link to advanced content:

```markdown
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents

Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents

For simple edits, modify the XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)
```

Claude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.

---

## Guidelines

- **Avoid deeply nested references** — Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.
- **Structure longer reference files** — For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.
