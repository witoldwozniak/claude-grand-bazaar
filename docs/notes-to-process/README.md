# 🧿 Claude Grand Bazaar

*Welcome, traveler. Come in, look around.*

Everything on these shelves was made by hand. We read the papers, studied the craft, argued about the details, and only then put it out for sale. You won't find half-baked goods here — no knockoffs, no "works on my machine" specials, no hastily assembled bundles of markdown with a nice README on top.

We sell plugins for Claude Code. They're opinionated, research-grounded, and built to last. If you want something that just technically works, there are other stalls. If you want something *good* — pull up a chair. There's tea.

This place is also a workshop. Building a good plugin means understanding the domain it captures — and sometimes discovering new ways of working with Claude Code that nobody has documented yet. If that takes time, it takes time.

## Why This Place

The coding agent ecosystem is in a Cambrian explosion. Skills, agents, hooks, and extensions are proliferating across Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, and others. The only quality signals? Downloads and stars.

Popularity measures virality, not correctness. A skill that sounds confident will outperform one that's actually grounded in how LLMs process instructions, because most people can't tell the difference by reading the markdown. Platforms like skills.sh and Context7 solve discovery but not curation — they're search engines, not quality gates.

The Grand Bazaar exists to raise the bar. Not by gatekeeping, but by demonstrating a different approach:

- Research sources are documented. You can check our work.
- Design decisions are recorded. You can understand why we made the choices we did.
- Opinions are traceable to evidence. When we take a stance, we show what informed it.
- The process is visible end-to-end. You can reproduce it, review it, amend it.

That's the alternative to trust: transparency.

## Scope

We'd rather have five excellent plugins than twenty mediocre ones.

## What's on the Shelves

Every plugin is built from six kinds of goods:

**Skills** are the spice of this place — knowledge and reasoning, dried and ground fine. How to think about a problem. What the research says. What steps the masters follow. Each one is a small education.

**Hooks** are the locks on the doors. Automated guardrails that fire whether the agent remembers them or not. If something must happen every time, no exceptions, no excuses — it's a hook. You don't negotiate with a lock.

**Agents** are the master craftsmen. Each one works a single trade — architecture, testing, security — and carries their own tools. You don't ask the silversmith about leather. You go to the right bench for the right work, and you get work that a generalist wouldn't produce.

**MCP servers** are the trade routes. Connections to tools, APIs, and systems beyond the Bazaar's walls. Without them, you're shopping local. With them, the whole world delivers to your door.

**LSP servers** are the appraiser's glass. They see what the naked eye would miss — a type error the moment it's introduced, the definition behind a name, every reference to a symbol across the codebase. Real-time code intelligence that updates as the code changes. You don't guess at quality when you have a glass like this.

**Commands** are the bell at the counter. Type the name, get the service. Each one is a markdown file that becomes a slash command — a direct line to a specific workflow, a specific set of instructions, a specific way of working. Where skills activate on their own, commands wait to be called.

## The Main Hall and the Side Stalls

Everything is made to work well together, but nothing is mandatory.

In the **main hall**, you'll find the core — plugins for software engineering disciplines. Plugin authoring, documentation, testing, project management, frontend, backend, database work, and more as the shelves fill. These are designed to work together. Pick one, pick all — they compose like instruments in an ensemble.

Down the **side alleys**, you'll find stranger things. A Minecraft modding plugin. A newsletter manager. A prose writing toolkit. Each one stands on its own, built to the same standards but beholden to nothing else. These are the stalls that make a bazaar a *bazaar*.

## How We Make Our Goods

We study before we sell.

Every plugin starts in the library, not the workshop. Academic papers, published research from industry labs — that's the first stop. Community wisdom comes second, handled with respect but examined closely. We cast a wide net and pick carefully.

Where the literature is rich — TDD, debugging, code review — we start there. Where it's silent, as with Claude Code's hooks, the community is the frontier and we explore alongside them.

Research serves building. We know when to stop reading and start making.

## Our Opinions

Every plugin has a point of view — a specific, considered, sometimes stubborn opinion about how things should be done. We built it that way on purpose.

Want to argue about it? We love a good argument — find us in Discussions, make your case. Constructive criticism makes the goods better. But if you're looking for a plugin that tries to please everyone, you're in the wrong bazaar.

## On Roles

Our agents play roles, not characters. An architect agent isn't wearing a costume — it's a craftsman that sees structure and ignores everything else. The role earns its place by producing work that an unscoped agent wouldn't.

When a team of agents coordinates in parallel — a lead delegating to specialists — that's orchestration, not theater. The test is simple: does the structure produce better work, or does it just look impressive? We only stock what passes.

## The Docs

Future us are strangers to us now.

If you can walk into the Bazaar, pick up a plugin, and understand what it does, why it exists, and how to use it without asking anyone — the docs are good enough. If you can't, they aren't. That's the bar.

## The Crowd

The Grand Bazaar is open and craves the hum of a crowd. Discuss, complain, praise, ask, request, challenge, suggest. The stalls are better for it.

We supply the first batch — the plugins we believe should exist. Beyond that, if people buy, we sell. We don't build in isolation and we don't pretend to know every corner of every craft.

Direct contributions will be welcomed through a structured process when the Bazaar reaches v1.0. Until then, we accept bug reports, change requests on individual plugins, and plugin requests if you want something we don't stock yet.

## Where We Sell

We build for Claude Code. That's our stall, that's our market.

Cowork is our neighboring stall. It shares Claude Code's plugin format — same manifests, same directory structure, same marketplace catalogs. Plugins built from Skills, Agents, MCP servers, and Commands work on both platforms. Plugins that use Hooks or LSP servers are Claude Code-only. We note which is which.

Beyond the Anthropic ecosystem, portability is a courtesy. The goods underneath are model-agnostic markdown and scripts — you can carry them elsewhere if you wish. But we won't reshape our stall to fit someone else's arcade. The coding agent landscape shifts with every release, and chasing compatibility across all of them is chasing a moving target. When the ecosystem settles on shared conventions, we can talk about ports.

## What You Won't Find Here

A few things we don't stock:

**Magic beans.** Nothing here promises self-evolving intelligence or autonomous improvement. We sell tools, not prophecies.

**Costumes.** Our agents have roles, not backstories. If a role doesn't change the output, we don't carry it.

**Autopilot.** A human is in the loop. Always. The plugins make the agent better at its job — they don't replace the person giving it one.

**Vibe coding fuel.** These plugins make deliberate work better, not mindless work possible. Bring your intention or don't bother.

**Goods for every market.** We build for Claude Code. If you need something universal, that's a different shop — and it doesn't exist yet.

## The Standard

Nothing reaches the shelves without meeting the standard:

- **Studied.** Core decisions trace back to real sources — papers, published research, or carefully vetted practice.
- **Clear.** A stranger can walk in, pick it up, and know what it does without asking anyone.
- **Composable.** It sits well alongside everything else in the main hall.
- **Decided.** It takes a position. No hedging, no "you could also try…" — that's not how we do things here.
- **Proven.** It's been used in real work. We don't sell untested goods.
