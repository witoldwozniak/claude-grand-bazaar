# {Question as Title}

## Motivation

Why this question matters. What decision, design, or understanding depends on
the answer. One to three paragraphs max.

Link to the triggering context — a conversation, a design doc, an ADR, a
frustration.

## Scope & Constraints

What this research covers and — critically — what it deliberately excludes.
Name the boundaries upfront so the DoD is evaluable.

## Method

How you investigated. Be specific:

- Sources consulted (docs, papers, repos, experiments)
- Sources excluded and why
- Search strategy (what queries, what tools)
- Any experiments run (with setup and results)

This section exists so future-you can judge whether the findings are trustworthy
or whether the method was weak.

## Findings

The substance. Organize by whatever structure fits the question:

- For technical reference: schemas, behaviors, edge cases
- For design exploration: frameworks, tradeoffs, options considered
- For decision support: options with evidence for and against

Write in prose. Use code blocks, tables, and diagrams where they earn their
place — not for decoration.

Cite sources inline: `[Source Title](url)` or footnotes for offline/paywalled
material. Every factual claim needs a source or an explicit "this is my
inference" marker.

## Limitations

What you didn't find. What remains uncertain. Where your sources disagreed.
Where your method was weak. Where the findings might not generalize.

This is the most important section. Research without stated limitations is
advocacy.

## Conclusions

Direct answer to the research question. If the answer is "it depends," specify
on what. If the answer is "we don't know yet," say what would resolve it.

Keep this short. If someone reads only Motivation and Conclusions, they should
get the full picture.

## Appendix (optional)

Raw data, full transcripts, extended code samples, or anything too bulky for
Findings but worth preserving.
