# Claude Grand Bazaar

A plugin marketplace for Claude Code and Cowork.

Opinionated, research-grounded plugins built from six primitives: **Skills** (knowledge and reasoning), **Hooks** (automated guardrails), **Agents** (focused specialists), **MCP servers** (external connections), **LSP servers** (real-time code intelligence), and **Commands** (user-invoked entry points).

## Philosophy

Quality before quantity. We'd rather have five excellent plugins than twenty mediocre ones. Every plugin is research-grounded, well-documented, composable, opinionated, and tested in real work. See [Doctrine](docs/doctrine.md) for the full principles.

## Status

Marketplace v0.1.0. Contributions open after v1.0.
